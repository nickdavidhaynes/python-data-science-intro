    "### Stepping wayyyy back - what is a computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "During WWII, mathematical foundations of modern computing were invented out of necessity. In 1945, John von Neumann drafted a design for a *stored program computer*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/von_Neumann.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A processing device\n",
    "    - Control unit for storing instruction sets\n",
    "    - Logic unit for executing those instructions\n",
    "- Memory for storing data\n",
    "- External mass storage\n",
    "- Input/output lines for communicating with the world\n",
    "\n",
    "The advance over previous designs: instead of \"hard-wiring\" (literally) a program, design a device that takes in a program just like data. The logic unit is able to execute a limited number of operations. By composing those operations together, can prove *mathematically* that we can solve any problem that is solvable (ignoring resource usage...). *This is still fundamentally the way computers work today.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast-forward 70 years, how do modern computers store and process data?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ComputerMemoryHierarchy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What does that mean for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For large organizations, real tape backup is a thing! https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\n",
    "- Most of us store data long-term on hard drives\n",
    "- When actively working on a project, our data lives in RAM\n",
    "- When in the middle of a computation, data is shifting from RAM to CPU cache\n",
    "- CPU actually does work on bits that are in its registers\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical computing workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Want to process some data stored on a hard drive (either physically connected to our local machine or accessible over a network connection)\n",
    "- Provide the address of that data and some information for how to load it into memory\n",
    "- Provide a set of instructions for what to do with the data that's in memory\n",
    "- Write intermediate results to memory\n",
    "- Store final results on a hard drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - modern computers handle the RAM <-> Cache <-> CPU pipeline for us. But understanding how it works allows us to write faster code (will return to this later today)."
