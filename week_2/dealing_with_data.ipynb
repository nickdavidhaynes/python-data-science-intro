    "- A processing device\n",

    "- External mass storage\n",
    "- Input/output lines for communicating with the world\n",
    "\n",
    "The advance over previous designs: instead of \"hard-wiring\" (literally) a program, design a device that takes in a program just like data. The logic unit is able to execute a limited number of operations. By composing those operations together, can prove *mathematically* that we can solve any problem that is solvable (ignoring resource usage...). *This is still fundamentally the way computers work today.*\n",

    "## Storing data (on disk)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways that data can be stored on disk, and different formats can have drastic performance differences! Fundamentally, the data contained in a file is represented in a computer as a sequence of bits (0s and 1s), which are grouped into chunks of 8 called bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Because data on computers can only be represented as sequences of 0s and 1s, we need a way of representing numbers (both integers and decimals) in this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we represent integers on a computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a super simple world, where the only integers we ever wanted to talk about were 0 and 1. We would only need 1 bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/1_bit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to remember that a blank bit corresponds to \"0\" and a filled bit corresponds to \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead, we lived in a world where the only integers we ever wanted to talk about were 0, 1, 2, and 3? In this case, we would have to use 2 bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2_bits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we lived in a world where we only cared about integers 0-7, we could use 3 bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/3_bits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we can always use $N$ bits to represent $2^N$ unique integers. Conversely, we can represent $M$ integers with $log_2 M$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In low-level languages like C and FORTRAN, integer types are given *fixed-width* representations. For example, a C `short` contains 2 bytes, so can represent $2^{16} = 65536$ unique integers. Depending on whether the integer is *signed* or *unsigned*, the bit patterns correspond to either 0:65535 or -32,768:32,767. Therefore, the integers 720,913 or -56,093 can't be represented with C `short` values - an integer type with more bits is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, in contrast, only has a single integer data type (`int`, as we introduced last week). Python algorithmically determines the number of bytes required and automatically allocates the necessary memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your turn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list of 0s and 1s and produces the corresponding integer. The equation for converting a list $L = [l_1, l_2, ..., l_n]$ of 0's and 1's to binary is $\\sum_i l_i*2^i$. What is the integer representation of `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`?"

Decimal numbers are trickier - in principle, decimals can have any length (including, probably, infinite). How can you possibly represent a infinite number of decimals with a sequence of bits?\n",

    "This behavior is a result of the finite precision with which Python is representing decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most software (including Python) uses the concept of *floating point* numbers (i.e. `float`s) to represent decimals. Essentially, a `float` is really two separate numbers: the *mantissa* and the *exponent*. This is a similar concept to scientific notation, where, for example, the number $123456.789$ can be written as $1.23456789 \\times 10^5$. In this case, $1.23456789$ is the mantissa, and $5$ is the exponent. In binary, we usually represent numbers as a string of bits, plus an exponent of 2 (rather than 10). This is a much more compact way of representing numbers than, for example, an explicit grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [more complete discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Floating-point_numbers) of floating point arithmetic is beyond the scope of this course, but the important thing to remember is that a floating point number is really represented with 2 numbers under the hood."

To the early computer pioneers in the 60s and 70s, the majority of whom lived in English-speaking countries, 256 characters was plenty - there were 26 upper case characters, 26 lower case characters, 10 digits, some special symbols like \"(\" and \"&\", and a few accented characters.\n",

How exactly this works is beyond the scope of this class, but suffice it to say - you should keep in mind that Python loops are *slow*.\n",
