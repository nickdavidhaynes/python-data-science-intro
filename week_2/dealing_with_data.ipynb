    "During WWII, mathematical foundations of modern computing were invented out of necessity. In 1945, John von Neumann drafted a design for a *stored program computer*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/von_neumann.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A processing device\n",
    "    - Control unit for storing instruction sets\n",

    "- Memory for storing data\n",
    "- External mass storage\n",
    "- Input/output lines for communicating with the world\n",
    "\n",
    "The advance over previous designs: instead of \"hard-wiring\" (literally) a program, design a device that takes in a program just like data. The logic unit is able to execute a limited number of operations. By composing those operations together, can prove *mathematically* that we can solve any problem that is solvable (ignoring resource usage...). *This is still fundamentally the way computers work today.*\n",

    "What does that mean for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For large organizations, real tape backup is a thing! https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\n",
    "- Most of us store data long-term on hard drives\n",
    "- When actively working on a project, our data lives in RAM\n",
    "- When in the middle of a computation, data is shifting from RAM to CPU cache\n",
    "- CPU actually does work on bits that are in its registers\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical computing workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Want to process some data stored on a hard drive (either physically connected to our local machine or accessible over a network connection)\n",
    "- Provide the address of that data and some information for how to load it into memory\n",
    "- Provide a set of instructions for what to do with the data that's in memory\n",
    "- Write intermediate results to memory\n",
    "- Store final results on a hard drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - modern computers handle the RAM <-> Cache <-> CPU pipeline for us. But understanding how it works allows us to write faster code (will return to this later today)."

To the early computer pioneers in the 60s and 70s, the majority of whom lived in English-speaking countries, 256 characters was plenty - there were 26 upper case characters, 26 lower case characters, 10 digits, some special symbols like \"(\" and \"&\", and a few accented characters.\n",
