    "![](images/repl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a program called CPython (written in C, hence the name) that parses, interprets, and executes code written to the Python language standard. CPython is known as the \"reference implementation\" of Python - it is an open source project (you can [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) and build the source code yourself if you're feeling adventurous) run by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) and led by Guido van Rossum, the original creator and \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type simply `python` into the command line, CPython brings up a REPL (**R**ead **E**xecute **P**rint **L**oop, pronounced \"repple\"), which is essentially an infinite loop that takes lines as you write them, interprets and executes the code, and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, try typing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> x = 'Hello world\"\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "```\n",

    "We can accomplish the same result by typing the same code\n",

    "into a file called `test.py` and running `python test.py` from the command line. The only difference is that when you provide the argument `test.py` to the `python` command, the REPL doesn't appear. Instead, the CPython interpreter interprets the contents of `test.py` line-by-line until it reaches the end of the file, then exits. We won't use the REPL much in this course, but it's good to be aware that it exists. In fact, behind the pretty front end, this Jupyter notebook is essentially just wrapping the CPython interpreter, executing commands line by line as we enter them.\n",

    "When we were looking at the methods in the various data type classes above, we saw a bunch of methods like `__add__` and `__pow__` with double leading underscores and double trailing underscores (sometimes shorted to \"dunders\"). As it turns out, underscores are a bit of a *thing* in Python. Idiomatic use dictates a few important uses of underscores in variable and function names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underscores are used to separate words in names. That is, idiomatic Python uses snake_case (`my_variable`) rather than camelCase (`myVariable`).\n",
    "- A single leading underscore (`_my_function` or `_my_variable`) denotes a function or variable that is not meant for end users to access directly. Python doesn't have a sense of strong encapsulation, i.e. there are no strictly \"private\" methods or variables like in Java, but a leading underscore is a way of \"weakly\" signaling that the entity is for private use only.\n",
    "- A single training underscore (`type_`) is used to avoid conflict with Python built-in functions or keywords. In my opinion, this is often poor style. Try to come up with a more descriptive name instead.\n",
    "- Double leading underscore and double trailing underscore (`__init__`, `__add__`) correspond to special variables or methods that correspond to some sort of \"magic\" syntax. As we saw above, the `__add__` method of an object describes what the result of `some_object + another_object` is.\n",
    "\n",
